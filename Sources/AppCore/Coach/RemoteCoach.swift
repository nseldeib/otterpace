// MARK: - Remote AI coach (Milestone 3)
//
// The real-LLM coach. When the user has connected their own Anthropic API key,
// `AskCoachView` calls this instead of the deterministic `CoachEngine` mock. The
// shape is intentionally identical to `CoachEngine.reply` — same `CoachReply` out
// — so the rest of the app doesn't care which coach answered.

// Architecture (the "BYO key, proxied through a backend" model):
